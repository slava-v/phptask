# PHP test project

Given we have a very simple and _crude_ application in legacy php with following file structure:

```
\index.php ( entry point)
\app.php
\person.php (entity)
\config.php (configuration file)
```

# Tasks

1. Using SOLID principles implement a logging feature and integrate it in current application structure
2. Finish the implementation of the method: `getPersonObjectFromJson`
